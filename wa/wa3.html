        <p>Outer Wilds is a 2019 action-adventure game developed by Mobius Digital and published by Annapurna Interactive. The game follows the player character as they explore a planetary system stuck in a 22-minute time loop that resets after the sun goes supernova and destroys the system. Through repeated attempts, they investigate the alien ruins of the Nomai to discover their history and the cause of the time loop.</p>

        <p>The game began development in 2012 as director Alex Beachum's master's thesis. He was inspired to create a game focused on exploration in which the player character was not the center of the game world. Beachum led a small team in building the game, first as an independent project, then as a commercial game at Mobius after the project won the Excellence in Design and Seumas McNally Grand Prize awards at the 2015 Independent Games Festival. Annapurna joined the project as the publisher in 2015 and funded its expansion beyond a student project.</p>
        
        <p>Outer Wilds was released for Windows, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 in 2019, for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in 2022, and for Nintendo Switch in 2023. An expansion which explores further themes in a new location in the planetary system, Echoes of the Eye, was begun in 2019 and released for the same platforms in 2021. Outer Wilds was positively received upon release, with most critics acclaiming its design and some criticizing the uneven difficulty of gameplay and pursuing the game's mysteries. Echoes of the Eye was also positively received, with some criticism for its introduction of horror elements. Outer Wilds was featured in several game of the year lists for 2019 as well as game of the decade and game of the era lists, and won in multiple categories at award shows, including the Best Game award at the 16th British Academy Games Awards.</p>

            <h3>Early Development and Prototypes (2012-2014)</h3>

            </aside>
            <p>The development of Outer Wilds began in late 2012 as Alex Beachum's thesis for his master's degree at USC Interactive Media & Games Division. Beachum was the creative director for the project, which he developed along with other students from USC, and student artists from Laguna College of Art and Design and Atlantic University College.[13][14] Beachum reused elements from previous projects at the school, including a planetary system changing over time, a planet falling apart, and trees that moved when they were not observed. His goal was a game where the player would engage in space exploration in an open system that changed over time, with the primary goal being the exploration itself rather than traditional gameplay elements like resources or conquering. The game universe was designed to not be centered on the player, in that it continued to change whether or not the player was present or performing actions. He was inspired by the "spirit of space exploration" in an uncontrollable environment in the films Apollo 13 (1995) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), and took cues from The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker's (2002) non-player characters that would tell tales of distant lands to entice the player to explore those areas for themselves, and the sense of impending doom of The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask.</p>
            <p>Initially unsure of where to start, he was encouraged by a fellow student to make an "emotional prototype" of the game he wanted to make; the result was a short sequence of the player roasting a marshmallow over a campfire while the sun explodes above them. Beachum kept this as the core of the game thereafter, representing the theme of the differences in scale between forces outside the player character's control and the small moments they could focus on instead. At the conclusion of his thesis, the game had the core gameplay mechanics of the player exploring a planetary system until the sun explodes and resets the time loop, along with the central puzzle of the time loop itself and the planets that were included in the final game.
            </p>
            <p>After graduating in May 2013, Beachum took a job at the newly formed Mobius Digital, founded by his classmate Loan Verneau, who had worked on the Outer Wilds project, and actor Masi Oka.[18] Several other members of the development team were hired by Mobius as well, as Oka had seen the game at a USC exhibition and was impressed by their work.</p>

            <h3>Early Design Success and Crowdfunding (2015-2018)</h3>
            <p>The team submitted Outer Wilds to the 2015 Independent Games Festival, where it won the Excellence in Design and Seumas McNally Grand Prize awards, and received honorable mention for the Excellence in Narrative and Nuovo Award categories. In response to its positive reception, Mobius took the game on as a development project, with the aim of spending a year polishing it into a commercial game for Windows.[18] Mobius launched a crowdfunding campaign for the game on Fig, the platform's first, raising US$125,000.[22] Beachum continued as creative director for the game, with Verneau as a designer, Logan Ver Hoef and Jeffrey Yu as programmers, and Beachum's sister Kelsey as writer. Mobius additionally hired art director Wesley Martin, who had initially seen the game at IGF.[18] During this second phase of development, the team focused on creating a unified art style for the game and refining the design, but due to the time and budget constraints did not try to expand the game's size or increase the visual quality beyond the IGF version. Mobius later stated in 2024 that they did not expect that the game would reach a wide audience and would likely result in the closure of the studio, but that it could not afford to create a more complete and polished game.</p>
            
            <p>During that year of development, Annapurna Interactive approached the studio to be the publisher, buying out the investment and rights from Fig.[23] The original investors in the game received a 245% return on their investment.[24] Annapurna, in turn, pushed for the game to be more than a polished student project, and the development timeline was extended, delaying the planned launch from 2016 to 2018.[23] This was later delayed to 2019, with the game also planned for release on the Xbox One.[25][26] Mobius began work with Section Studios, a video game art company, to develop concept art for the revamped game. The two companies went through several iterations of design prototypes, while Mobius built development tools, before they aligned on a coherent aesthetic and Mobius built a vertical slice of Giants Deep for Annapurna. Mobius then hired an in-house art team and built the rest of the game as the last phase of development.[14]</p>

            <h3>Release and Success (2019-present)</h3>
            <p>Outer Wilds was released digitally on PC and Xbox One on May 28, 2019.[27] In exchange for additional financial support, the game was initially a timed exclusive on the Epic Games Store, delaying support for a Linux version.[28] A PlayStation 4 version was released on October 15, 2019, a PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S version on September 15, 2022, and a Nintendo Switch version on December 7, 2023.[29][30][31] A physical PlayStation 4 version was released by Limited Run Games in 2020, and physical PlayStation 5 and Switch versions are planned for release as part of collectors editions by iam8bit and Happinet in 2024.[32][33][34] A concept art book with developer commentary, Field Guide to the Outer Wilds, was released in 2024.[35]</p>

            <p>Outer Wilds received "generally favorable reviews", according to the review aggregator Metacritic. Its aggregated scores ranked it as one of the top 30 games of 2019 for Windows, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.[52] It was estimated as having sold over 2 million copies by August 2021, just before the expansion was released.[54] The game was featured in several game of the year lists for 2019,[55][56][57][58] including overall game of the year by Eurogamer and Polygon,[59][60] and Edge, Polygon, PC World, and Paste also featured it on their "best games of the decade", "best games of the console generation", and "best games of the past 30 years" lists,[61][62][63][64][65] while Eurogamer in 2024 said it was the 3rd best game that was available for current systems.[66]</p>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <img src="/img/gamePlay1.png" alt ="Outer Wilds gameplay" width = "300">
        <p>Outer Wilds is an action-adventure game set in a small planetary system in which the player character, an unnamed space explorer referred to as the Hatchling, explores and investigates its mysteries in a self-directed manner. Whenever the Hatchling dies, the game resets to the beginning; this happens regardless after 22 minutes of gameplay due to the star going supernova. The player uses these repeated time loops to discover the secrets of the Nomai, an alien species that has left ruins scattered throughout the planetary system, including why the star is exploding.[1] A downloadable content expansion, Echoes of the Eye, adds additional locations and mysteries to the game.[2]</p>

        <p>The Hatchling moves around the game space by walking and jumping; if they are wearing their spacesuit they may also use its jetpack to propel themselves upwards.[3] The spacesuit has a limited supply of fuel, which can be refilled at specific locations, and a limited supply of oxygen, which is refilled when the Hatchling is near trees.[4] If the Hatchling runs out of fuel, they can use oxygen as a propellant. Running out of oxygen, hitting an object or surface too hard, or being crushed will injure the Hatchling or damage their suit, killing them if too much injury is sustained.[5] While wearing the spacesuit, an interface showing the remaining fuel and oxygen is shown. Damage to the Hatchling is shown by their suit icon turning red, with no explicit health amount given.[6] The Hatchling also has a signalscope, which can be used to scan for the source of audio transmissions.[7]</p>

        <p>The Hatchling can also freely fly a small spacecraft throughout the planetary system. The spacecraft and the celestial bodies of the system follow an exaggerated system of Newtonian physics, causing the planets and other bodies to swiftly orbit the sun and exert their own variable gravity fields, and requiring the player to counteract their own momentum to slow down while flying.[1] Collisions can damage parts of the spacecraft and make them inoperable; too much damage can destroy it and kill the Hatchling, but can otherwise be repaired by exiting the spacecraft and interacting with the damaged component.[8] Both the spacecraft and the spacesuit can launch a small probe to light up an area or take pictures.[9]</p>

        <p>The player character can only carry a single object at a time. Nothing is brought back with the Hatchling when the time loop resets, with the exception of the data on the spacecraft's computer, which displays the information and mysteries that the player has found so far, organized either by location or in a web of connections.[10] Locations evolve throughout the duration of the time loop, such as parts of a planet collapsing or sand flowing from one area to another, making some areas only accessible from specific points in the time loop.[11] Other people throughout the planetary system can be communicated with in text-based dialogue trees, while Nomai writing, found in their ruins and presented as a branching tree of messages, can be read with a translator tool.[4][9]</p>

            <h3>Gen 1 - "The Strangers"</h3>
            <img src="/img/stranger.png" alt ="A Stranger" width = "300">
            <p>The story of Outer Wilds begins with the Strangers, a curious and intellecutal species living peacefully on a lone planet. After receiving a signal older than time, they realize their next purpose, and decide to travel to this signal, which happens to be the eye of the Universe. They strip all there home planets' resources to build an intergalactic space station capable of traveling to this ancient signal, but as a result, there original home had now been completely inhabitable. Determined to find the answer of the universe, and perhaps the secret of immortality, every single one of the Strangers boarded this spacestation and left their home planet forever.</p>

            <p> The Strangers arrived at the signals location, a normal solar system that sits right near the center of the universe, also where the game takes place. Hastily, they followed the signals coordinates, but were horrified with what they had learned. They did not in fact find the answer to immortality, but found out about the inevitable death of their universe. This was extremely heartbreaking for the strangers, and angry with the universe, and the fact that they could never return home, they turned there backs on the universe, and went on to research immortality themselves. This led them to create a virtual world where they can enter, and never leave, even when the universe ended. They also created a probe that would block of the eye of the universes' signal, so no other being can find out about the unvierse's eventual end.
            </p>

            <p>One Stranger retaliated against this virtual world, and as a result, disabled the probe that blocks the eye's signal briefly. This Stranger was prisoned in both the real world and the virtual world for all eternity, as punishment, and the probe was enabled to block the signal quickly by the other Strangers.</p>

            <p>Although the probe was disabled for only a little bit, the signal was emitted all over the Universe, and was picked up by another intelligent and curious species, the Nomai.</p>

        </section>
        <section id="gen2">
            <h3>Gen 2 - "The Nomai"</h3>
            <img src="/img/nomai.png" alt ="A Nomai" width = "300">
            <p>The Nomai were a large and prominant intergalactic species. They lived in different clans throughout the Universe, and when one of these clans detected a brief signal older than time itself, this clan hastily traveled to this signal without communicating with other clans. Since the signal was so brief, they would have lost it if they has not traveled to it immedietly. This clan traveled using their Vessel capable of intergalactic travel, but when they reached the signal's coordinates, they were ensnared by one of the Solar Systems planets, which is later known as the planet "Dark Bramble." The Vessel sent out 3 escape pods, one landed on the planet "Brittle Hollow", one landed on the planet "Ember Twin," and the other never made it out of Dark Bramble, killing the Nomai inside that escape pod.</p>

            <p>This was a brutal loss and setback for the Nomai, but they had to quickly work to be able to survive their respective planets. After establishing themselves on each planet, they were able to communicate with each other across the solar system, eventually developing technology to travel throughout the Solar System. After this setback, the Nomai were able to properly greive and return to their mission of finding the Eye of the Universe.</p>

            <p>However, they soon realized that the signal that they were receiveing wasn't being emitted anymore, so they had to replan everything, and thus began their research. There are 3 main points of research the Nomai were investigating, since there were many strange elements within the Solar System they had now called home. One point of research was the Quantum moon, a strange moon the orbitted every single one of the planets, and moved orbits dependant on observation. However, sometimes the moon wasn't orbitting anything, thus they hypothesized that the Quantum Moon was the Eye of the Universe's moon, and theorized this as a way to locate it. Landing on this moon proved difficult, but after much research and attempts, they were able to do so. Homwever, although they could orbit the Eye of the Universe, they still didn't know where it was, since they discovered it was increible small to the outside observer (and perhaps even invisible to the naked eye). The quantum moon was then turned into a ritualistic area, where young nomai would travel to when they were of age to learn more about their purpose. </p>

            <p>The second point of research was the Black Hole, which was the center of the planet "Brittle Hollow." Any Nomai that fell through would transport outside of a white hole, a short distance ouside of the solar system, where they built a white hole station to transport any  Nomai back to the solar system. However, a huge discovery was made by one of the Nomai, stating that anyone who fell into this black hole would exit the white hole sligthly before they entered, meaning that time travel was possible. This lead to there 3rd point of research, the Ash Twin project.</p>

            <p>The Ash Twin project was there last hope on finding the Eye of the Universe. Using the Quantum moon, they knew that it existed, and that it existed SOMEWHERE, but they didn't know where. They had probes they would send out, but finding the small source of singal would take million of years. But since they recently discovered time travel, they began work of the Ash Twin Project. The Ash Twin Project utilized the power of the Sun to produce time loops, using there knowledge of warp technology and black holes. They calculated that the amount of energy from the solar systems sun going super nova would produce a 22 minute timeloop. How this worked was they would store there memories in statues before the supernova using there advanced technolgy. Once the Ash Twin project was activated via super nova and warp/black hole technolgy, they would launch a probe in a random direction. After the supernova killed off the nomai, they would time loop 22 minutes, without knowledge that many timeloops have passed, and eventually, the probe would find the eye and send back the data via the statues. A very complicated process that theoretically could work. The Nomai had one problem, they couldn't get the Sun to supernova quicker with their technology.</p>
            <p>The end of the Nomai was a quick and sad end. While researching the acceleration of the Sun's life span, a foreign body entered the Solar Sytem. Eager to check it out, the Nomai were horrified to see what had entered the solar system. A element deadly to all Nomai. Before the few Nomai investigating this foreign body could warn the others, the element core exploded, releasing deadly gas throughout the solar system in a split second, killing all Nomai present. A quick and morbid end to an incredibly intelligent and persistant species.</p>

            <h3>Gen 3 - "The Hearthians"</h3>
            <img src="/img/hearthians.png" alt ="A Hearthian" width = "300">
        <p>
            The Hearthians actually exisited during the time of the Nomai, but they were a waterborne species at first. They survived they deadly gas that killed off the Nomai since the gas didn't hurt anything in water. After some time, the Hearthains evolved into land creatures, inhabiting the surface of a Earth-like planet that was eventually named "Timber Hearth." As the Hearthians continued to evolve and grow, they became as curious of the Nomai, since there reminants were scattered throughout the solar system. They developed there own space travel, through the Outer Wilds Expedition. You play as one of these Hearthians. After the Sun supernovas after it's natural life span, your character finds themselves stuck in a 22 minute time loop, and must discover the secrets of the Nomai, the Strangers, and what they were searching for.
