<p>Hello! My name is Maximilian Dietz, but I go by Max! I'm a Creative Tech and Design major and Computer Science minor studying game 
    development and audio engineering. I'm a huge nerd and have a passion for learning and teaching. Being able to study the different 
    niche's of game development through this program has truly been life changing, and I love learning about it all!!! I also focus on sound design
    (current LA for Sound in ATLS) and I'm also incredibly passionate about music! I'm a multi-intramentalist (Guitar and Bass) and I surround my work with music. I have a deep love for Post-Hardcore 
    and Emo music, and I take inspiration from bands like The Obsessives, Free Throw, Heart to Gold, and Knola (just to name a few)
