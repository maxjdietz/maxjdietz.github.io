<p>Hello! My name is Maximilian Dietz, but I go by Max! I'm a 4th year Creative Tech and Design major and Computer Science minor studying game 
    development and audio engineering. I'm a huge nerd and have a passion for learning and teaching, and being able to study the different 
    niche's of game development through this program has truly been life changing, and I love learning about it all!!! I focus on sound design
    (current LA for Sound in ATLS) and I'm also incredibly passionate about music! I'm a multi-intramentalist (Guitar and Bass) and I typically surround my work with music. I have a deep love for Post-Hardcore 
    and Emo stuff, and I take inspiration from bands like The Obsessives, Free Throw, Heart to Gold, and Knola (just to name a few) when I write my own stuff. I even have a radio show
    where I play this type of music every week! Ouside of hobbyist stuff, I'm also currently studying for my Music Technology certificate, where I 
    like to make and replicate soundscapes and soundtracks to video games! I'm a very motivated person and hope to somehow work on video games for a living!!!!
    </p>
<p>Outside of studying, I'm a very active person, I love to weight lift and play Basketball. I also like to cook, program, sketch, work on games, play games (primarily Dark Souls and indie games), jamming with my bands, and watching sports with my roomates! I've been meaning to take Web
    for a while, but have been putting it off due to scheduling conflicts, but I've always wanted to make my own portfolio website from scratch, so 
    I can customize it to my liking, and thats what I'll accomplish after I take this class! Looking forwad to learnign about it all, I have been loving the content so far!!!!
